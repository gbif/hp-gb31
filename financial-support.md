The GBIF Secretariat offers the possibility of applying for partial financial support to attend the Governing Board meeting on XX-XX XXXXX 2024. Support may include funding of economy-class tickets and a subsidy to cover accommodation. 

**The application process is now open**

Please see below for more details on the guidelines for seeking partial funding for the Governing Board meeting. Link to the application form can be found at the bottom of this page. 

Deadline for applying is **XX XXXX 2024**.

The GBIF Secretariat will inform applicants about the outcome of their application shortly after the deadline. 

##Guidelines for seeking partial funding

Partial financial support for the Governing Board meeting is only available for GBIF Voting Participants representing developing countries that are in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions. 

Developing countries are defined as countries whose per capita GDP was less than USD 13,500 according to the 2020 World Bank figures, the benchmark used to apply discounted contributions in the current GBIF funding period (2023-2027). See list of developing GBIF voting country members here. ADD LINK

Only one person per Voting Participant, the Head of Delegation, is eligible for partial support. However, the Head of Delegation can reassign the support to a member of the delegation. 

##How to apply

Fill in the GB31 partial financial support application form here ADD LINK and submit it no later than **XX XXXXX 2024**. 

The application must include the following information:
- A confirmation that the attendee will 1) be able to cover the costs of the flight ticket up front and then be reimbursed after the meeting, or 2) a request for GBIF to directly book and pay the flight ticket (direct economy-class ticket from home country to Porto and back only).
- The number of hotel nights requested
- A confirmation that the attendee will be able to cover all other costs (visa, health and travel insurance, per diem, etc.)

**Please note that funding will as a rule not be provided in advance of the meeting but by reimbursement after the meeting. Applicants may, however, apply for GBIF to pay the air ticket costs directly. If selected for funding, the GBIF Secretariat will send the reimbursement form for the air ticket costs (if not already covered directly by GBIF) and the accommodation subsidy. The reimbursement form must be submitted together with proof of costs within one month after the meeting.**
